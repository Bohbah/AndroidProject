## Overview
### Description
Allows members of Greek organizations on college campuses to more easily communicate and plan events with other chapters via chat and calendar features. 

### App Evaluation
- **Category:** Social Networking
- **Mobile:** This app will be developed for mobile but would perhaps be just as viable on a computer, such as GroupMe or WhatsApp. Functionality wouldn't be limited to mobile devices, however mobile version could potentially have more features.
- **Story:** Allows members of the Greek Life community on a college campus to connect with other chapters on their campus and on other campuses.
- **Market:** This app would target undergraduate college students who are part of a Greek organizations. 
- **Habit:** This app could be used as often or unoften as the user wanted depending on how deep their social life is, and what exactly they're looking for.
- **Scope:** First we would start with one region of the United States with known Greek Life presence, but would expand to include chapters nationwide. Large potential for use on college campuses in the South.
